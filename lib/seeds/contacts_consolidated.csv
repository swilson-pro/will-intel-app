Almost 20 years ago, I started working for L'Oreal - the world's leading beauty company - and had diverse opportunities to grow the business in various markets around the world. Now leading an amazing, energetic team who inspires me daily, together we democratize the best of beauty across our diverse portfolio of brands and product categories throughout North America, activating game-changing consumer initiatives in a fast-paced, dynamic organization.

Connecting with people and creating human connections across L'Orealand our fascinating beauty industry energizes me - it's about gaining insights and unleashing human magic. It's the joy of mentoring, coaching, and growing high-performing teams.

Besides being a beauty enthusiast, I'm committed to elevating women in the workplace and empowering the next generation. Whether it's sharing career advice with college and MBA students or connecting with our DE&I affinity groups. I'm also a strong advocate for pay equity, gender equity, and investing in women in STEM because we're all worth it. 

As a board member for DermTech, a public American biotech company, I work with the board and the leadership to transform lives through the genomic revolution in skin health. 

Personally, I'm a French native and world citizen. I‚Äôm also a proud wife and working mom who is devoted to family and committed to career. It's my mission to set an example for my daughter that women can break through any barriers to pursue their dreams and succeed!

Her tenure saw the L'Orealbrand‚Äôs strongest years of growth in the decade - reaching the 4 billion euros mark in 2009 - while her decision to evolve the slogan of L'OrealParis to ‚Äúbecause we‚Äôre worth it‚Äù cemented the brand‚Äôs commitment to inclusivity.

Alexandra Palt,,L'Oreal,Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer and CEO of the Fondation L‚ÄôOr√©al,"As Executive Vice-President Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer of L'Orealand Executive Vice-President of the Fondation L‚ÄôOr√©al, my mission is to ensure that we collectively go beyond the transformation of our business model to build a more inclusive and sustainable world. We had already started it with our first sustainability program with targets set to 2020, and are now accelerating with our new program L'Oreal for the Future, with a new generation of bold sustainability targets for 2030.

Ever since I studied law specialized in human rights in Austria, I‚Äôve felt drawn to issues centered on women‚Äôs rights and asylum rights, and started working with different NGOs. While taking part in the European ‚ÄúPreparing Young Women to Lead‚Äù program, I was mentored by the then Secretary General of Amnesty International in Germany. 

When I moved to France, I started focusing on human rights and corporations as well as environmental issues. I became Executive Vice-President for equal opportunity at the HALDE, France‚Äôs High Commission against Discrimination and for Equal Opportunities, then was an independent consultant on sustainable and social issues. Throughout my career I have strived to face the world‚Äôs challenges and to make a positive impact. 

I joined L'Orealin 2012 as Chief Sustainability Officer, later becoming Executive Vice-President of the Fondation L‚ÄôOr√©al. As a leader of our industry, we want our contribution to be exemplary. Over the last ten years, we have undertaken an in-depth transformation to reduce our impact across our entire value chain. However, as environmental and social concerns increase, we know that this is no longer enough. 

With L'Orealfor the Future, we are aiming for an even more radical transformation: put L'Orealin line with the only possible scenario for humanity, respecting planetary boundaries across the entire lifecycle of our products. Our responsibility is to take into account our impact beyond L‚ÄôOr√©al, by involving our entire ecosystem (our consumers and suppliers). And through the programs of our Fondation, we are also aiming to build a more inclusive world by empowering women to shape their life and the world. 

Because we believe we have a double role to play in society: achieve a sustainable transition for ourselves and our ecosystem, and above all, contribute to face the world's challenges.

***************************************************************

After receiving a Master's degree in International Business and Finance in 1996, I joined the Clarins Group International Marketing Development Division. A first experience in the field gave me the taste for business, and i was be named Deputy Managing Director for the French subsidiary two years later. 
 
This productive experience opened the doors for me to international operations. In 2006, at the request of the sons of the Clarins founder, i became the first woman expatriate president of two Group subsidiaries in Spain and Portugal at the age of 32.

With the help of the team, we accelerated the development of the Group's beauty and fragrance brands ‚Äì Clarins, Azzaro and Mugler ‚Äì over a period of five years. We developed strategic partnerships by opening the Group to the distribution of new brands with the Interparfums Group. 
During this time, Clarins rose from seventh to third position on the beauty care market.

Committed and tenacious, I am a woman of challenge and adventure. In parallel to the Clarins Group, I created a digital start-up with my husband and developed it for five years. 

In 2013, I became President of Clarins Fragrance Group and Mugler Fashion, with a major challenge to meet, relaunch the dynamic of fragrance and fashion brands.
Enthusiast, i love to share my energy to the teams and puts expertise and vision at the service of Group brands. The Azzaro brand recovered a worldwide dynamic with the major launch of Azzaro Wanted

Christophe Babule,,L'Oreal,Group Chief Financial Officer - Member of the Group Executive Committee,"As L‚ÄôOr√©al‚Äôs Group CFO, I make Finance a leading drive at the core of our Group‚Äôs transformation journey. 

L'Orealis a personal story to me, one that started in 1988, year of my graduation.

Commitment and passion are the emotions that led me to take my first job in the Group, in Italy at our Luxe Division.  There followed years of passionate work as CFO, first in China then in Mexico. After these fantastic human and business experiences abroad, I moved on to Paris as Internal Audit Director, before heading back to Asia as L'OrealAsia-Pacific CFO. In 2019, I was named Group CFO and Executive Vice-President.

In each of the positions I held at L‚ÄôOr√©al, I appreciated the range of our assets: our ability to outperform our competitors on each market and in each continent, the strength of our business model, the innovative spirit of our teams, the loyalty of our shareholders, and our long-term vision based on values. 

32 years on, the ideals of my youth have endured and thrived at L‚ÄôOr√©al. I still have the same curiosity about the world, and the same eagerness to protect it while transforming it.

My interest in different cultures and various ways of life lies at the core of my vision of human richness. At L‚ÄôOr√©al, I strongly value the diversity of our teams and the various backgrounds of our employees: they are a driving force for L‚ÄôOr√©al‚Äôs renown and growth in a global world.

My other passion is sailing. I love gliding on water at wind speed, as much as quietly savoring the beauty of the seas. This bond with nature gave me a personal awareness of the need to protect our environment by our collective commitment.

Today, as L'OrealCFO, I have a unique opportunity to use my passion for transformation and my commitment towards sustainability to nurture our Group‚Äôs lasting growth and along with the Finance teams, identify new sources of value creation, key for our future.

Renata Avediani,,L'Oreal,Head of People Development & Learning LATAM,"Human resources professional, graduated in journalism in the Pontificia Universidade Catolica of S√£o Paulo. I have specialized myself in career management and labor climate, working 7 years in a famous Brazilian magazine called Voc√™ S/A (from Editora Abril publishing company). 

Over eight years, I was responsible for more than 100 reports and articles. As part of my job as well, I visited more than 200 companies (approximately 800 hours of interviews with employees) throughout all of Brazil for the VOC√ä S/A-EXAME Guide entitled ""The Best Companies to Work for  ‚Äì  for"", which I was the coordinator. I also coordinated the creation and implementation of a pioneer study focused on young employees, entitled: ""The Best Companies for Starting a Career"", published for the first time in 2011. 

I had a 2 years experience living in Mexico, where I worked as an editing consultant on a variety of projects in Grupo Expansi√≥n, which is part of Time, Inc.

In 2013 I decided to change my career to human resources. I consider that my expertise, gained with all these experiences as journalist, could contribute to bridge the gap between the employees' experience & expectation and the company culture & processes. In this context, I have started my career in L'Oreal Brazil. I was part of the HR Learning team, responsible for trainings, organizational development, people engagement and the evaluation tool. 

Over these years in L'Oreal, I had different roles and challenges within the learning community, being in the Brazilian and/or the zone team. Leading transformation processes, leadership development, behavior changes and employees engagement initiatives, besides the coordination of the LATAM learning community. 

I have a huge sense of accountability, commitment and autonomy to make things move forward. I am also recognized for being able to inspire, create communities, foster cooperation & transformation.",,,"S√£o Paulo, S√£o Paulo, Brazil",,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAADXBK8BrrGtfufrWXhT0wRdwGwBTfsyzZ0/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1662,1,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQHg6zPBBEXumw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1517707054825?e=1669248000&v=beta&t=3JiwCW1fprdOrCHiLB3aK_eN26aa7ZxPHACwakVGKtE

Extensive Experience as CFO in North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Exposure to Consumer Goods, Financial Services and Retail / Distribution.

Understanding the business needs, bringing financial expertise to the discussion, and collaborating with business partners supporting strategic decisions, is how we tackle complex business challenges in a successful way.

Passionate about my teams and ways of working, I believe the transformation agenda can be handled with transparency, dialogue, making sure everyone has context for the decisions made.

Vianney Derville,,L'Oreal,President Europe Zone / Member of Group Executive Committee,"I joined L'Oreal almost 30 years ago. I did not imagine at that time I would be a man of one company. 
I am still at L'Oreal simply because I have been lucky enough to constantly learn, discover new cultures, new ways of working, to get exciting challenges, and the most important, to work with passionate people, smart people, inspiring people‚Ä¶ and because I am having a lot of fun ! Not everyday of course but most of the time.
And also because L'Oreal stands for values that are important to me: believing in people before processes, standing for sustainability with very concrete actions behind an ambitious program, for true diversity and inclusion, and with a constant quest of innovation and superior quality. 
Beauty is an industry I love because it‚Äôs about product performance, solving consumer problems, making them feel better. But also because it‚Äôs about emotion and aesthetic. 

Over the years I have had the chance to live with my family in Japan (fascinating), Spain (energizing), the US (understanding what scale means) and France.

My job is President for the L'Oreal‚Äôs newly created Europe Zone.
Together with my team, we are accelerating the transformation of L'Oreal in Europe to invent the future of beauty. A beauty powered by green sciences and technology. A beauty that is diverse. A beauty that is committed to the planet and to society. In a word a beauty that moves the world.

L'Oreal is a French company, a European company: we also want to contribute to a Europe that is agile, bold and innovative.

I am a doctor specializing in dermatology, clinical pharmacologist and manager of international projects with a solid experience in defining strategic orientations and partnerships in the field of inclusive skin sciences.

#empoweringwomen #allovertheworld
As the first woman to lead L'OrealParis worldwide, I am honored to continue the commitment of an iconic brand to the emancipation of women. I am the head of a dedicated team; we are compelled to uphold the values and mission of L'OrealParis through the choices we make and the actions we take.

#aspirational #accessible #efficacy #transparency #safety 
As an engineer who trained at the Institut National Agronomique Paris Grignon, I have always strongly held the opinion beauty should not be the exclusive preserve of the privileged few, but available to all. L'OrealParis beauty is aspirational, yet accessible to everyone, worldwide, without ever compromising on superior efficacy, absolute transparency and above all, safety. 

#sustainability #duty  
As a brand that bears the name of the world‚Äôs largest beauty group, I feel a responsibility that L'OrealParis has a duty to meet the biggest global warming challenges humanity is facing. 

#Inclusivity #diversity #sisterhood 
Inclusivity, diversity and a sense of sisterhood are not trends, they are fundamental pillars of L'OrealParis‚Äô positioning, values which I hold very close to my heart. I champion the bond between women of every age, lifestyle and nationality. My conviction: we may be both a feminine and a feminist brand.

Alexia Esther,,L'Oreal (China) Co.,Executive Director,"After graduating from Columbia University, I joined my uncle's group as a shareholder and grew into an investor. Although the number of Chinese women holding shareholder positions is on the rise, in order to achieve better results, I think; women in the workplace need to recognize their strengths, build self-confidence, and work hard for the goals they set. Whether it's a three-year plan or a five-year plan, you must persevere, stay focused, and work toward your goals.
After achieving greater development, it was recognized by friends, and finally signed a contract with a friend company. Since then, I have continued to expand the investment field. Of course, I'm also a growing businesswoman. At present, there are investments in hotels, real estate, restaurants, SPA, medicine and other fields.",,,"New York, New York, United States",,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAD2uY8kBviboxnh79QML9kTVeNo0P9yhy5I/,,1,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFZulZ7r3vUyw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1661999727331?e=1669248000&v=beta&t=5cn9WBCf9D56LgUlM9rk-9KOi497ApTq9gXe69VPcB0

Vania LACASCADE,,L'Oreal,Global Brand President Vichy,"I‚Äôm the Global Brand President of Vichy Laboratoires, a member of the L'OrealActive Cosmetic Division‚Äôs Management Committee, and a Doctor in Pharmacy by training.

I have had the opportunity to experience a diversified international career, starting in the luxury market at LVMH, where I was the head of Givenchy Skincare, followed by an entrepreneurial adventure, before finally joining the L'OrealGroup in 2010 in the Consumer Products Division. 

At L‚ÄôOr√©al, I began as the International Head of Marketing for Garnier Skincare, before moving to lead the Garnier Marketing Hub in China. In 2014, I was nominated as the Deputy Brand General Manager for The Body Shop in London and in 2017, I joined Lancome‚Äôs Board of Directors to lead the brand‚Äôs international marketing strategy for skincare. In 2019, I was appointed as the Global Brand President of Vichy Laboratoires.

All these experiences have influenced who I am today. I have often been told that I have the particularity of balancing my scientific and rational left brain well while using my emotional instinct and creative boldness to open myself to innovation through my right brain.

As a scientist, I always considered skin as a vital organ and a barometer of our health that we need to understand and take care of. Skin is our first line of defense and it‚Äôs essential to preserve our skin‚Äôs health capital over time. At Vichy, our brand tagline ‚ÄúHealth is vital. Start with the skin"" is the foundation of everything we do.

As a Doctor of Pharmacy, I took over Vichy Laboratories with the strong desire to revive the medical roots of this leading dermo-cosmetic brand, through the innovations we are carrying out. I truly believe science is the most powerful tool to preserve and optimize our health.

As a manager of a large, international, diverse team, I want to make Vichy an inspirational place to work, share my expertise and vision with my team. I truly believe people flourish and are inspired when they feel connected, recognized, and responsible.

As a leading woman of a big organization, I believe passion, resilience, bravery, positivity, and purpose drive success. My life experiences have given me the chance to play a role in pushing the boundaries of health, embracing sustainability and inventing dermatological solutions for all.

As a mother of 2 daughters, I have always believed that it is possible for a woman to seek both an exciting professional life and a fulfilling personal life. I commit to teach my daughters that experiences and connections enrich life, and that we must make every moment count.",,,France,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAMc2r0B3vjwBcOmBveaoHf1lngtv7AlEkk/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1662,1,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQH1Nn_tno8rag/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1604397895981?e=1669248000&v=beta&t=AoOXOgN0qNKCx8U1kf-nA6JiZG_QQP3i-5UeDtau29I

An Verhulst-Santos,,L'Oreal,President and CEO of L'Oreal Canada,"I am Belgian and since July 2021 I have the privilege of being President and CEO of L'Oreal Canada. Our sense of purpose is to create the beauty that moves the world. A beauty that is positively impacting our planet and all of its inhabitants. A beauty that is a force for creation, innovation, and self-expression and drives freedom and empowerment. A beauty that is a force that fosters exchange and promotes sharing, that brings barriers down and communities together. 
I work at the number 1 beauty company in the world for more than 30 years. My career began in 1991 at L'Oreal's Professional Product Division in Belgium. Between 2005 and 2009, I acted in this division in Brazil and I was responsible for building the ""Hairdressers against AIDS"", L'Oreal's worldwide preventive education program in partnership with UNESCO to promote the prevention of AIDS.

After that, as the head of this division in the United States, I worked on the implementation of the SalonCentric project, L'Oreal USA's professional product distribution operation.
From 2011 to 2016, I participated in the Executive Committee of the L'Oreal Group as President of Professional Products Division, reporting directly to CEO and Chairman Jean-Paul Agon, and I worked strongly in the acquisition of the professional cosmetic brands Decl√©or and Carita, as well as in their integrations, turning the Division into a global player in the professional beauty market.

Asmita Moghe,,Coty,Trade Marketing Project Manager - Global Luxury CCO,"Hello!

üíÑI am Asmita, an Indian with a passion for the Beauty Industry which led me to Paris to study ‚Äú Masters in Management ‚Äú at ESSEC Business School. My undergraduate degree in Pharmacy really opened my eyes to the world of cosmetics and the world of Youtube turned me into a makeup junkie.

üëâüèªAfter some key roles in the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare sector, here is how I have made an impact in the Beauty Industry.

üëâüèª In the Global Luxury Consumer and Market Insights team at Coty I got the opportunity to identify and synthesise key insights on several projects, eventually leveraged by the marketing teams for New Product Development as well testing upcoming campaigns.

üëâüèª As a Consumer Marketing Assistant for Estee Lauder, I deep dived into the world of media marketing. Here I got the opportunity to explore my analytical as well as creative side, an experience I thoroughly enjoyed.

‚≠êÔ∏èMy winning project for the LGBTQ community as part of the Leadership and Diversity Chair at ESSEC gave me the opportunity to become a delegate for the ‚ÄúOne Young World‚Äù , 2021 summit.

üëâüèª After delving in the world of Product Marketing and Visual Merchandising via a short stint as a Marketing Coordinator for Tom Ford Beauty, I now continue my journey in this field , getting a 360 view of the sector, as a Trade Marketing Project Manager for the Global Luxury Chief Commercial Office in Coty.

In my spare time I love watching Youtube videos, trying out new restaurants and listening to podcasts.

Hannah Nic Sceach√°in,,L'Oreal,Active Cosmetics Division - CDO Digital Transformation,"As a current student in the unique MSc in Digital Marketing & Data Science at emlyon business school, I am passionate about helping brands adopt a strong marketing-data science dynamic. 

I‚Äôm adventurous, curious and thrive in a multi-cultural environment. My current cohort at emlyon comprises 43 different nationalities, which enriches my learning experiences every day. My vibrant experiences studying and working abroad have undoubtedly contributed to my open-mindedness, creativity, and adaptability. 

When I am not developing data-driven marketing strategies, you can find me playing sport. I have an innate love of sport, particularly ladies‚Äô Gaelic football and camogie. As an amateur athlete, I have shown commitment and dedication commensurate with a professional. I have learned to balance each of my obligations, having played at inter-county level and working part-time while still achieving assignment deadlines at university.

Pauline Tombarello,,L'Oreal,Chief Financial Officer,"En activit√© depuis 12 ans en milieu industriel sur 3 sites de production, j'ai occup√© 4 postes diff√©rents en finance dans le secteur des cosm√©tiques.

J'ai int√©gr√© un comit√© de direction depuis 4 ans au poste de DAF ; une exp√©rience enrichissante suppl√©mentaire qui m‚Äôa permis de continuer de d√©velopper et mettre en pratique l‚Äôexpertise m√©tier, mais √©galement valoriser mes forces : l'√©coute, la transmission de comp√©tences, la coop√©ration et l'envie d'am√©liorer les process de travail via la digitalisation notamment.

Ma vision pragmatique, mon enthousiasme, ma rigueur et la fiabilit√© de mon travail, m'ont permis de r√©aliser des succ√®s. Au-del√† des r√©ussites m√©tiers comme la certification OEA, la mont√©e en puissance du contr√¥le interne et la conscience √©conomiques des sites, des formations √©conomiques, je suis particuli√®rement fi√®re du niveau de partage interg√©n√©rationnel et de coop√©ration que j‚Äôai install√© dans mon √©quipe actuelle.

Mes moteurs sont clairs : motiver, connecter, manager, transmettre, am√©liorer, √©couter.

Dr. Youmna Geha,,L'Oreal,Chair Leadership & Diversity,"After obtaining my PharmD in Lebanon in Saint Joseph University, I decided to continue my path at ESSEC Business School Paris in the Grande Ecole Master in Management Program. 

I‚Äôd describe myself as a young woman ambitious, commited and audacious. I‚Äôve always been extremely curious about everything in life; I write as a freelance journalist, I play high level competition sports (Basketball and Handball) and I fight a lot for what I believe in. 

Through my experiences (scouting, elective of my promotion, representative of the student councils, captain of the Handball team) I‚Äôve developed my leadership and my working in group skills! I find it profoundly interesting to lead each person of a group to the best version of himself/herself.


I am open to discovering the world, myself, the Management world, the deep connections this world has to offer and the enrichment I will get through my journey! 
All in all, I am a passionate young woman about life, in all its circumstances. 

Finally, If I have to confess hating something in life; I would definitely say stagnation.

Bryan Mahoney,,Groupe Marcelle,Board Member,"As a long-standing advocate and architect of API-first commerce solutions, I‚Äôm on a mission to help founders and teams‚Ä¶

1. Deepen their relationship with technology to build better businesses.

2. Make crucial technology decisions to bridge knowledge gaps. 

3. Understand the build versus buy question to roll up their sleeves and scale with purpose.

I‚Äôve been lucky enough to work with and shape some of the world‚Äôs most innovative brands, like Glossier, Blue Bottle, Honest, and Samsung.

Today, I support the next generation of founders and commerce brands with Chord‚Äôs commerce-as-a-service platform, connecting with the hearts and minds of customers every step of the way. Having grown out of arfa, a consumer goods business that developed personal brands, Chord is the extension of my belief in creating brilliant, unforgettable commerce experiences.

My goal is to give founders access to the same tools as the biggest and most well-funded D2C players. 

Earlier in my career at Glossier, I wrote the company‚Äôs first line of code, was its first engineer hire, and scaled its tech team to beyond 65 people. 

During the Dot Com boom, I started Dynamo‚Äî a direct-to-consumer digital design agency‚Äî with a friend of mine from McGill University. We delivered commerce stacks with recruiting and retention in mind for early-stage, venture-backed startups. The agency survived 25 years, resulting in a team of exceptionally talented designers, programmers, UI/UX specialists, and managers.

What started out as a way to make money while in school, led me to where I am today:  grateful to have built a career out of my love for enabling early growth stage brands to reach their full potential.

I have a passion for building things‚Äî personally, and most importantly, my home in New York with my wife, daughter, dog, and grumpy cat. Professionally, tech stacks, startups, and diverse, distributed teams. And there‚Äôs a small business side of me working on a grassroots winery in Santa Barbara.

Dr. Ayesha Khanna,,L'Oreal,"Member, Scientific Advisory Board","Hi and thanks for stopping by! I'm a data geek on a mission to help companies and people reach their potential through the innovative and responsible use of data. Making data and AI more accessible and usable, whether in the physical or virtual worlds, can empower people to innovate, create and build more easily.

I'm an advisor to CEOs and Boards on how to become globally competitive data-driven organizations. As Co-Founder and CEO of Addo, an artificial intelligence solutions firm, my rockstar team of data engineers and machine learning scientists build intelligent data platforms for some of the world's largest enterprises. For our clients, these platforms turn their data into gold and form the foundation for using machine learning to automate, optimize and innovate their processes. 

A passionate advocate of teaching women about AI, I am the founder of 21C Girls (21st Century Girls), a charity that teaches girls the basics of coding and artificial intelligence. And I'm launching Squad, a global women's collective that teaches women about Web3 (crypto, blockchain, NFTs, metaverse) and is the world's first job board for women in Web3. Every gal in our programs makes me super duper proud!

I'm also a huge believer in human-centred technology. Throughout my college years, I volunteered in human rights organizations and I strongly support movements for data dignity, digital justice, and AI ethics.

Finally, I'm a city-lover who has lived in New York, London, Boston, Berlin, Singapore, and Lahore. As a big people person, I love meeting interesting people with diverse interests and passions! I wanted to study how cities can benefit from big data and wrote my Ph.D. on smart city information systems.

Hassan Soueidan,,Coty,Assistant Brand Manager - Rimmel London,"I am a business administration student that believes to achieve long-term social change through the requirement of the composition of knowledge, negotiating skills and hands on experience with several sectors in development supported by disciplined rigid administrative management. I want to explore the boundaries of my performance and increase my competency to take part in projects managing investments related development programs to ensure the balance between charity and financial viability.

      My professional motivation is to work in a challenging work environment with the possibility for professional growth. In the following I wish to highlight my key competencies and personal passion for working with quality coordination and administrative support.
       Providing executive link between the various administrative functions has been a guiding light in my career choices thus far. In my roles, although very different in nature, the common denominator has always been the drive to support program mechanisms through research. Through interacting with colleagues and stakeholders, I tend to quickly observe and analyze individual roles, opportunities, challenges and motivations. One of my professional achievements was the coordination and direction of Beauty Line Company. 
During the process I had to accommodate interest of various stakeholders, observe different information flows while meeting tight deadlines.
Having worked with Al-Urduniah Travel and Tourism as an accountant assistant; in addition, to my previous experience with Bestseller ‚Äì Jack and Jones, I have developed a structured mindset, client oriented attitude and strong ownership to deliver high quality results. I believe that my background and diverse experience could bring effective problem solving skills and support to any company.",,,"Paris, √éle-de-France, France",,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAACxhTc4B2AYBeEJWSuK1xTu_WKsZTrGljqQ/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/5058,1,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQEYvWRES_n5UA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1649454501897?e=1669248000&v=beta&t=xL2maAw0AqSIwWSlY8QEK9pQYKbBzMPhmixkibdSHiw

Emanuele Monti,,L'Oreal,"Professional Market, Director","Sono pap√† di Ettore, ho 37 anni e tantissima passione per il mio lavoro. Amo le sfide e il cambiamento, cerco di dare il massimo per la mia comunit√† potendo in parte contribuire al successo collettivo a beneficio di tutti. Di certo sono un pragmatico, a volte troppo. 

Sotto la mia storia, se ti va di curiosare, in qualche riga:

Dal 2018 presiedo la Commissione Sanit√† di Regione Lombardia, con 20 Miliardi di Euro di budget annuale tra i Sistemi sanitari principali al mondo. Sono impegnato nella ricerca a fianco delle aziende, la Lombardia √® il primo produttore di farmaci in Europa e il 14.2% del PIL Lombardo √® legato agli ambiti di mia competenza.
Ho promosso numerosi provvedimenti legislativi, dalla legge 23/2020 contrasto alle droghe e dipendenze alla legge 24/2020 che ha messo in sicurezza il sistema sociosanitario post covid. Certamente il provvedimento pi√π rilevante √® stata la legge 22/2021 di Riforma del Sistema Sanitario regionale con 2 Miliardi di Euro di stanziamenti e la riorganizzazione complessiva della medicina territoriale per oltre 10 Milioni di cittadini.

La mia formazione istituzionale parte nel 2006 da Consigliere comunale, ruolo ricoperto per 3 legislature, Consigliere Provinciale e Consigliere Regionale dalla X legislatura.
Sono stato nel board di diverse societ√†/Istituzioni, tra queste certamente l'Universit√† Carlo Cattaneo LIUC √® stata un esperienza di grande valore.

Professionalmente sono Dirigente nella pi√π grande Azienda cosmetica del Mondo, L'Oreal. Avventura iniziata nel 2008 da neolaureato con ruoli diversi dal commerciale al finanziario passando per la gestione retail e di sviluppo del business oltre che di direzione dei pi√π importanti brand del gruppo. In 14 anni ho avuto l'occasione di lavorare su 7 diversi brand internazionali nella divisione luxe e professional, guidare lo sviluppo omnichannel e multibrand dell'industria e raggiungere importantissimi risultati di business in un contesto di forte cambiamento. Ho sviluppato da zero per l'azienda un nuovo canale legato alle vendite ai dipendenti in Italia e in diversi paesi nel mondo contribuendo ad un nuovo modello di business che oggi √® un successo riconosciuto ovunque.

La mia formazione √® economica con una laurea 110/110 all'Universit√† Carlo Cattaneo LIUC in Economia e numerosi master e formazioni executive nelle principali universit√† al Mondo, da INSEAD in Francia a IESE a Barcellona, Londra sia in LSE che all'Imperial College e infine a TOKYO presso la KEYO Business school.  

Dovrei fare pi√π sport che adoro, seguo l'arte e amo stare con la gente.

Noor Kaur,,L'Oreal,Consumer and Market Insights Co-Op,"I am a Senior at the Gabelli School of Business at Fordham University Lincoln Center pursuing a B.S. in Global Business with a Consumer Insights and Marketing concentration and a Sustainability minor. While at Fordham I spent a semester studying at Fordham's London Centre campus. I am pursuing full-time sustainability opportunities in New York City.

I have held a number of sustainability internships with some of the world's leading companies including The Estee Lauder Companies and ViacomCBS.  At Viacom, I have been instrumental in supporting a racial justice community partnership with CBS Sports that offers marginalized youth positive role models in the sports broadcast industry as well as planning and executing Virtual Community Day, company-wide community building day where VIacomCBS employees lend their expertise to local nonprofits. I was honored to interview five ViacomCBS Impact Award recipients and learn how their volunteer work benefited their communities and write an article, ViacomCBS Puts a Spotlight on Employees Who Exemplify Volunteerism with the Impact Awards, that was published on 3BL Media, a sustainability news portal.

At The Estee Lauder Companies, I was a Global Corporate Citizenship & Sustainability intern where I worked with a team of sustainability professionals to perform a competitive benchmarking of skincare and make-up consumer products companies to establish best practices for cause marketing and philanthropic donations. My findings were summarized in a PowerPoint presentation which was influential in allocating over $300,000 in grants. I also performed extensive research on racial equity metrics to inform a scale for evaluating grant applications and was instrumental in planning an employee speaker series featuring Brian Stevenson, author of Just Mercy.

Finally, I have spent nearly three years working for the Palms For Life Fund, a global non-profit dedicated to restoring basic human rights supporting their mission through planning and executing a social media strategy.  

On-campus I have also gained valuable exposure to corporate social responsibility through my work as the Vice President and Mentor for Social Impact 360 a group that aims to instill a socially conscious mindset in college students.  I am also active on campus writing for Fordham's student newspaper, The Observer, serve as Co-President of the Dean's Council, and as a Captain of Urban Plunge, a student community service, and social justice organization.

Obaa Amponsah,,L'Oreal,Research & Innovation Summer Intern,"I'm a current chemistry major at Howard University, who plans on pursuing a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences with the aspiration of becoming an innovative and inclusive cosmetic scientist. Some of my research interest include stratum corneum homeostasis, barrier functionality, efficacy of natural products, and more. I believe the application of such research to product formulation would result in major innovation in product development and ensure inclusivity of sensitive skin, black skin, and healthier and effective skin solutions.
As a young social entrepreneur, I tackle the issues of mass exploitation of Africa's resources and the capitalization of the false narratives of the continent in the industry. I focus on improving self esteem, community, and insight into the continent through my research and its application to the real world i.e skincare products and the community inspired around them.
Such ventures have afforded me the win of Social Impact 360's 2020 Shift series, a pitch competition for social entrepreneurs. As well as, the opportunity to be co-lead mentor at Social Impact 360's Howard Chapter, to afford Howard's freshmen this same opportunity.

I'm an Operations Management & Business Analytics major and Philosophy minor at the University of Maryland, College Park passionate about business leadership oriented towards our social obligation to bring about a greater good in the world and learning how to heed equitable systems throughout the world in the corporate and public sectors.

Through my interest in human behavior and personality tests, I have found my passion for the role psychology plays in the business environment. The intersection between psychology and business is where I find the necessity of strategic design in implementing solutions in that process. Investigating methods about people, organizational effectiveness, and its applications have transitioned to be where I see my best fitting role.

Ashley Caldwell,,L'Oreal,Executive Assistant to 2 Vice Presidents | Time Management | Organization,"Zero... that‚Äôs how many people purchased my service when I first launched.

I remember that time like it was yesterday; I‚Äôd spent weeks building out the modules, creating the PowerPoint slides and drafting what I thought was my marketing launch plan. 

Imagine the devastation I endured, once I realized that all of my hard work and effort was tragically going down the drain.

That one failed attempt didn‚Äôt stop me though! I kept going back to the drawing board and trying again. It was literally one failed attempt after the next. I made not one sale from any of my launches!

I started joining free masterclasses, webinars and challenges hoping to learn my sales and marketing mistakes. The additional free information made it worse! I was piecing together different marketing and sales tactics, trying to make it all work for my business. None of it worked at all. 

At this point I was frustrated, confused and beginning to lack confidence. I had thoughts of quitting this newfound second business and just focus all of my energy back on the first one. My passion wouldn‚Äôt let me though! I knew I could master the online sales and marketing beast.

FAST FORWARD TO TODAY AND THINGS HAVE DRASTICALLY CHANGED! I‚Äôve had 5-figure launches in under 7 days! It‚Äôs surreal to see just how far I‚Äôve come in such a short period of time.

My second business is thriving; I‚Äôve created a warm engaged audience that‚Äôs ready to buy. I‚Äôm no longer scared to launch and hear crickets because I finally understand the psychology behind sales and marketing.

My businesses run and generate sales on autopilot while I work 9 ‚Äì 5; just how an employee would. I unplug worry free and dedicate my evenings and weekends to spend time with my family. With my effective marketing strategies in place, I know sales will continue to generate without much manual effort from me.

My mission today is to help service-based women entrepreneurs scale to consistent 5K months so they can surpass their 9-5 income. I know how frustrating and confusing it can be to learn sales and marketing. 

If you‚Äôre a service-based entrepreneur, let‚Äôs connect to see how my sales and marketing coaching can help you generate you consistent sales online. 

My goal for you? To surpass your 9-5 income so you can have the option to leave if you choose.

Mehreen Syed,,L'Oreal,Spokesperson,"Equipped with over 15 years of experience in modelling, acting and philanthropy, I started my social entrepreneurship journey with IFAP, a company that works towards skill enhancement for the economic benefit of women and girls. Soon I realised that there were far too many girls who needed financial and social help as well. So I set up ICARE, a not for profit organization that works towards women empowerment in all its nuances.
I strongly believe, that social conduct is extremely important and more so for the coming years. This is one of the ways that we distinguish ourselves from other species. Beauty and fashion are beyond gender and have the potential to impact every aspect of our lives be it ourselves, our homes, our work, our thoughts or our philosophies. In other words each and every part of our lives is impacted through our inward and outward conduct, beauty and fashion. All combined they give us that spring board of confidence that propels towards the greatness that we can all achieve. It is with this belief that I started IFAP and ICARE and I am humbled by their achievements even this short time since their establishment.",,,Pakistan,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAABtZ8uQB2SZzDEbu3pOSZ6IHPsyAQdU6Tk4/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1662,1,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQGBS550_t19_w/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1588722404165?e=1669248000&v=beta&t=5aSYSI3PA6YDavTm8xfXxVbNQhy-SDuo-p9woEvd33w

His latest vision, taken in the form of Cruxe, delivers the highest quality hardware and unparalleled education for the industry through a new lens and mindset. 

CRUXE- @cruxebrand
""I began the process of Cruxe after feeling a large gap in my connection to the industry. The products and the companies behind the items being sold felt unnatural and disconnected. I felt there was a need for our industry to have products/tools that stood for more than a gimmick pushed for a dollar sale that all too often carried a sense of dilution to our industry. Cruxe is the result of noticing countless observations and opportunities for progress in my first 10 years of the industry. Every product is designed down to the finest details to be efficient, modern, essential and luxurious delivered through a new set of eyes. It's about moving the focus back towards quality, connection and having a mindset that breaks the mold and questions the norm.""

"Stephen Davis CISM, CDPSE",,Revlon Inc.,Global Chief Information Security Officer,"Being selected by my peers in 2022 as one of North America‚Äôs top 100 Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) is truly an honor.

For over 20 years I have been recruited by firms like Revlon, Morgan Stanley, General Dynamics, W.R. Grace & Co., and others to lead cybersecurity teams, build cybersecurity programs, optimize supply chain risk management, ensure secure digital transformation, establish a global threat risk advisory, respond to cyber attacks, and perform other strategic, leadership and advisory roles in information security.

My efforts to advance cybersecurity both for the entities I‚Äôve worked for and the industry as a whole have yielded consistent, appreciable results. For example:

At Revlon, currently serving as VP Chief Information Security Officer, I am leading the development of our cutting-edge Enterprise Cybersecurity Program that protects the business systems, manufacturing operations and intellectual property of the company.

At W.R. Grace & Co. I designed and built the company‚Äôs first Cybersecurity Operations Center, armed with the industry‚Äôs most advanced cybersecurity protection systems.

At Morgan Stanley, I was brought in to reestablish trust in the company‚Äôs fraud investigation, threat monitoring and data protection after a major security incident.

On the industry level, I am a frequent speaker at conferences and roundtables, serve on several advisory boards and was selected for the Cybersecurity Observatory Hall of Fame for my contributions and influence in the cybersecurity community.

I was also a co-contributor to the industry textbook ‚ÄúWireless Security: Models, Threats, and Solutions‚Äù, published by McGraw-Hill.

My career has advanced on a solid educational foundation, earning my Bachelor of Science degree in Business at Fort Hays State University, Digital Transformation Certificate from Cornell University, and currently pursuing my Master of Science degree in Cybersecurity at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.

With energy and enthusiasm I look forward to the challenges ahead.

Nanette Wong,,"Kendo Brands, Inc.","Vice President, Global Brand Marketing, Fenty Beauty & Fenty Skin","At 25, I had a quarter life crisis. With a comfortable 9-5 job, no weekend work, and a great manager and mentor, what could be wrong?

Key word here, comfortable. 

What was missing was the challenge, the desire to push beyond my own boundaries and excel to be the best person, and as a result, best employee ever. As one who is always striving for more, I took action.

Turning my comfortable life upside down, I quit that comfy job and its benefits to be a benefit-less intern (thankful for Obamacare!). I changed my life and learned more than I ever thought I would. 

It was this fateful opportunity that sparked my interest in marketing. Following the internship, I honed my skills at a Fortune 500 CPG company, and then moved into tech. The time I spent in these varied industries is how I turned my interest in social media into a keen knowledge about consumer engagement and online brand presence. With a unique perspective and broad knowledge of the digital landscape, my expertise lays in building brands, storytelling, and globally integrated communications. I'm passionate about driving innovation in the space and continually pushing boundaries.

Being entrepreneurial has played a major role in my life since the age of 14, when my family took every penny that we had to buy a small motel.

In 2014, I became the CEO of e.l.f. Beauty; taking the company public in 2016. I am very proud of our team at e.l.f. Beauty. I lead with the motto, ‚ÄúOne team, One dream‚Äù, and I am committed to building a company culture that empowers our teams to move at e.l.f. speed to get things done.

I also held leadership roles at The Clorox Company, as GM of the $1.5 billion Litter, Food, and Charcoal divisions, taking those businesses to new records as well as creating the company‚Äôs Health & Wellness platform which helped double the size of the Clorox franchise.

"Brittany Chisum, MBA",,ColourPop Cosmetics,Vice President of Data Analytics,"Science or Art. Data or People. Metrics or storytelling. I don‚Äôt pick ‚Äúor,‚Äù I thrive with ‚ÄúAND.‚Äù Throughout my career, I not only focus on the technical skills needed to get the job done, but the soft skills and business acumen that are important to excel as a team. After all, if no one understands what I‚Äôm doing or the information they‚Äôre receiving, there‚Äôs really no point!  

I began my career in inventory management, where I gained a solid understanding of supply chain. I then moved to sales, operations, purchasing, and business intelligence, where in each area I learned what things really drive business decisions so I could put KPI‚Äôs in place to track enterprise business performance. This cross-departmental immersion allowed me to be successful in implementing a business intelligence platform company-wide. While this required strong systems knowledge, technical data transformations, data validation, and building visualizations, it also required a significant focus on the human aspect, finding innovative ways to change a culture to one that‚Äôs more data-driven. 

Most recently, I have been overseeing forecasting, inventory, S&OP, and analytics teams, building new data models from scratch, and forging my own path in both analytics and supply chain. This has been a theme throughout my career ‚Äì observing, understanding business needs, adapting my work to fit those needs, and working collaboratively to add value across the enterprise. In 2017 I went back to school to get my MBA so I could better understand how to identify those business needs and potential gaps I could fill. This was one of the best decisions I made for both my career and personal life, as I‚Äôve gained so much more than I ever realized I would being a UNC Tar Heel!",,,"Oxnard, California, United States",,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAhkuSQBO8vN5my_LZB4psngKs8ySn0FyTc/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/11171485,1,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQHVuC0hIxKJ-A/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1661205131206?e=1669248000&v=beta&t=9A3PydMT3FsOEF8tCrc67Q70XYNX-23QyubVUe56CXo

Linee Reeves,,Charlotte Tilbury Beauty,Makeup Artist,"My passion for makeup and fashion has been with me from a very early age. While in my teens I experimented a lot with clothes and makeup, giving tips, helping friends, and family with application, and always aspiring to somehow make it into a career. In 2008 I finally took it to the next level and decided I am going to do this. I decided to take a formal course on all aspects of beauty for television, print, movies, runway, bridal, etc. at Studio W of Honolulu. It went from being my passion and hobby into an overnight obsession and art.

Since then, I've worked with local photographers helping models with their portfolios, I've done weddings, fashion shows, organized makeup parties, coordinated an outreach to mentor young mothers on proper skincare and makeup application, and traveled to learn and grow more into my craft. I worked as a makeup artist at Sephora and grew into an Education Expert which then paved my way into becoming a Senior Makeup Artist.

I was able to gain more knowledge and experience at Sephora University in SF, and the Senior Artist workshop in NY where I accomplished my long time goal of going to the Makeup Forever Academy!

I continue to grow and learn from the most experienced makeup artists and estheticians in the industry. I have now branched out on my own building my business services ground up and offering top notch professionalism and quality makeup artistry.

I am currently open to contract/freelance for respective Cosmetics companies. I have done freelance for Guerlain, Cargo Cosmetics, Smashbox, Givenchy, and I formerly represented Josie Maran Cosmetics. 

The core of my business approach and lifestyle is:

Connect, engage, inspire.

I currently reside on the Island of Oahu

Sasha moved to Seattle in 2002 and engaged with several early stage companies whilst investigating possible ventures to launch on her own. She spotted a gap in the prestige beauty marketplace and founded butter LONDON in 2005. 

As CEO and Chairman, Sasha successfully built butter LONDON into the leading prestige nail lacquer brand recognized world-wide for its high fashion colours, non-toxic formulations, and dressing-table worthy packaging.  In July 2014, butter LONDON completed a significant financing and strategic partnership with Encore Consumer Capital.

Sasha is now focused on her latest venture, BEV√âE - a luxury handbag and accessories brand that is both ‚ÄòBeautiful and Brilliant‚Äô. Launched in March 2014 and available exclusively online at www.bevee.com, BEV√âE is fast becoming the bag of choice for Hollywood stars and NYC go-getters alike. 

Whether it‚Äôs combining designer and fast fashion or urban life and adventure sports, Sasha loves mixing it up. She is passionate about women‚Äôs causes and entrepreneurship. She has backpacked in every continent, except Antarctica, and counts family and friendships as her most treasured possession. 

Still a passionate Brit at heart, Sasha loves living in Seattle with her husband and three young children. Her mantra is, ‚ÄúIf there is fun to be had, I will find it!‚Äù",,,Greater Seattle Area,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAL6tdkB5La2_dXxjXbm8L9PO_I-yDPJKAs/,,1,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQHEhlA0h7rWUA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1516543019337?e=1669248000&v=beta&t=P3GfPviYJS1vwR0IacFbUK_nsx3g1irSGKOVrd1hkf8

Melissa Harvey,,Zorah biocosm√©tiques,Presidente,"As the President and co-founder of Zorah biocosm√©tiques, my never ending quest is to find effective cosmetics that are organic, ecological and fair-trade. That has led me to where I am today. 
During a humanitarian trip to Morocco I discovered the virtues of Argan oil. I was so impressed with the courage and determination of the Berber women who grow and produce Argan oil. Upon my return to Montreal in 2007 I founded Zorah biocosm√©tiques. Our mission is to offer high quality cosmetic care products equal to, or better than those available on the market, using organic, eco-friendly and fair-trade ingredients. 
I sincerely believe that we can all make a difference : it starts with educating people about dangers concerning their health and to the environment, starting with production right up to consumption, and by doing so we can make a difference and give our children a greener and fairer future.
