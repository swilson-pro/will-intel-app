Over the past year, we‚Äôve sold more than one product every second, opened the doors to our 35th store, and welcomed our 1000th employee. With many products in development, a new 70,000 square-foot HQ to call home, and plans for even further retail expansion, we are excited to do even bigger things in the near future.

DECIEM was founded in 2013 by ‚Äúthe beauty world‚Äôs most exciting disrupter‚Äù, Brandon Truaxe. During a four-month co-op at a skincare lab, he became angry at the lack of passion, transparency, or insight when beauty products were being developed. After selling his first software company, many years later, Brandon‚Äôs frustration at the beauty industry remained and he set off to make a change in the beauty business.

That change is DECIEM and we‚Äôre working really hard to continue Brandon‚Äôs vision for a better world of beauty. Everything we do is of exceptional quality. Today, quality is no longer defined by price points or distribution channels. Quality today means being authentic, being different, being functional, being beautiful, and being sensibly priced, even to the wealthy. And we respect these principles. We choose to serve the educated, the curious, and the intelligent who appreciate our dedication to this very genuine definition of quality.
